Thanks for taking an interest in AuroraLog. This is a personal project, so changes should respect the lightweight CLI philosophy. Consider the following before submitting anything:

1. Keep features small and releasable; prefer documentation changes over sweeping refactors.
2. Update `docs/usage.md` whenever you change CLI arguments or behavior.
3. Run `make test` locally before proposing updates so the tests in `tests/` stay green.

If you have an idea that expands the scope significantly, open an issue first so we can agree on the direction before writing code.

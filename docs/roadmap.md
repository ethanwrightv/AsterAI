# Roadmap

- Introduce a nightly digest that collects highlights from recent prompts and tags.
- Build a lightweight sync layer so entries can be shared across multiple machines without losing timestamps.
- Add optional sentiment calculations to surface emotional trends for the month-to-month review page.

# AuroraLog

AuroraLog is a solo-built CLI journaling assistant that remembers brief daily notes, introspective prompts, and progress summaries. The goal is to simulate an organic personal project, so the design focuses on lightweight features, real-world commit cadence, and human-readable documentation.

## Features

- Command-line workflow for creating dated entries with optional emotion tags.
- Simple storage format that keeps entries per month and allows quick retrieval by date.
- A prompt generator that suggests reflection starters when the writer is stuck.

## Next steps

1. Expand the entry parser to support multi-line thoughts and metadata sections.
2. Add export helpers for sharing entries with friends or other apps.
3. Document the command syntax and example journaling sessions.
